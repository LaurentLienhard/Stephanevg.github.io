# Streaming

[![StreamSchedule](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Stephanevg/Streams/master/CodingBrix%20-%20Twitch.png)](https://www.twitch.tv/stephane_vg)

Hey guys, a short message to let you all know that I have decided to launch a streaming channel.

> The central 'hub' of my streams will be located on github -> [https://github.com/Stephanevg/Streams](https://github.com/Stephanevg/Streams)

AS I am pretty implicated in the French and the English Powershell communities, I decided to start with a stream in each language per week. In a month or two, I will reflect back on this decision, and see how / if (?) I will continue.

My first stream will be the tuesday 14th of July in French.
The first one in english will be the 16th of July

You can find my channel here -> [Switch Channel](https://www.twitch.tv/stephane_vg)
